Performance & Assessment

The Director of Performance and Assessment supervises the Evaluation Committee which selects referees for ASAA Provincial assignments, City Championships, and consideration for the ACAC Panel; this includes ensuring the accessibility and safekeeping of evaluations done within the previous five years. The Director of Performance and Assessment may also coordinate with the Director of Referee Development to identify officials who seek to advance their NOCP level or the level of games they are eligible to officiate. A yearly mentorship program may also fall under the Director of Performance and Assessment's portfolio.

Evaluation Rubric

CBOA uses the most current NOCP 1 and 2 rubrics for the evaluations of its members minus the subsection score requirements. The rationale behind this is to best prepare the membership for their formal evaluations and help identify any areas of improvement as close to the NOCP guidelines as possible. It is the responsibility of every member requesting an evaluation to be familiar with the standards set in the documents below. - Jan 2022
